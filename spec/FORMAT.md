# Pack format (v1)

A pack is a `.zip` file. The same layout, unzipped, is what Developer mode
loads from a folder.

```
my-pack.zip
├── pack.json            required: the manifest
├── LICENSE              optional: your license text
├── main.js              the code (`main` in pack.json); can be one big file
├── lib/…                optional: more code or assets, imported by main.js
├── files.json           optional: per-file SHA-256 list (the build tool writes it)
├── files.json.minisig   optional: OmniShip's signature over files.json
└── packs/               bundles only: the packs this one includes
    ├── com.example.a/   a complete pack, same layout as above
    └── com.example.b/
```

Files sit at the zip's root, not inside a top-level folder.

## `pack.json`

Validated by [`pack.schema.json`](pack.schema.json). Unknown top-level fields
are rejected, so a manifest means exactly what the user was shown.

| Field           | Required | Rules                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apiVersion`    | yes      | Integer. The app must support it (v1 apps support `1`).                                                                                 |
| `id`            | yes      | Reverse-DNS style, lowercase: `com.example.my-pack`. At least one dot, 3–100 characters. Never changes.                                 |
| `name`          | yes      | 1–64 characters, shown to the user.                                                                                                     |
| `version`       | yes      | Semantic version without build metadata: `1.2.0`, `2.0.0-beta.1`.                                                                       |
| `description`   | no       | Up to 280 characters.                                                                                                                   |
| `author`        | yes      | `{ "name", "email"?, "url"? }`. `url` must be `https://`.                                                                               |
| `homepage`      | no       | `https://` URL.                                                                                                                         |

| `license`       | yes      | The pack's license, shown to the user: 1–100 characters, ideally an SPDX identifier such as `MIT`.                                      |
| `minAppVersion` | no       | Lowest eyeread.in version the pack runs on.                                                                                             |
| `main`          | see note | Path to the entry module, ending in `.js` or `.mjs`.                                                                                    |
| `permissions`   | no       | Map of permission → `{ "network"?: [sites] }` (`prompter:control` also takes `input`). Missing or `{}` means the pack asks for nothing. |
| `settings`      | no       | Declared settings (below), in display order. Up to 32.                                                                                  |
| `includes`      | no       | Packs this one bundles: `[{ "id", "version" }]`. Up to 32.                                                                              |

`main` is required, except in a pure bundle: a pack with `includes` and no
`permissions` may leave it out and ship no code of its own.

### Permissions

| Permission         | Lets the pack                                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts:write`    | Add scripts to the library                                                        |
| `prompter:load`    | Open text in the prompter and start a reading session                             |
| `prompter:control` | Play, pause, restart, seek, advance or close the prompter                         |
| `prompter:events`  | Read the prompter's state; the script is only described during an active session  |
| `files:import`     | Ask the user to pick a file with the app's own picker, and receive only that file |

These are the same names the Connected apps HTTP API uses as scopes, and they
share one grant model.

### Input (keyboard and mouse)

A permission that drives the prompter can also receive the user's keyboard or
mouse, through an `input` option. It works like `network`: declared per
permission, and off until the user turns it on for that permission. Only
`prompter:control` takes it, so input can only drive the prompter. It can't
become script text or a title, because `scripts:write` and `prompter:load`
never get it.

```json
"permissions": {
  "prompter:control": {
    "input": { "keyboard": { "keys": ["ArrowRight", "ArrowLeft"] } }
  }
}
```

`input` takes `keyboard` and/or `mouse` (at least one), and `scope`:

| Option     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `keyboard` | `{ "keys"? }`: receive key presses. `keys` is up to 64 [`KeyboardEvent.code`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code) values like `"Space"` or `"F13"`; when set, only these are delivered.                                       |
| `mouse`    | `{ "buttons"?, "wheel"?, "position"? }`: receive button presses. `buttons` is up to 5 button numbers (0 left, 1 middle, 2 right, 3 back, 4 forward); when set, only these. `wheel: true` also delivers wheel scrolls, `position: true` pointer position. |
| `scope`    | `"focused"` (default): events only while eyeread.in is focused. `"global"`: also when other apps are focused. The user can always choose `focused`.                                                                                                      |

The app runs a permission that has input in its **own sandbox**, with only that
permission's API, the input, and `net` if that permission declares `network`.
Input handlers can't reach `scripts:write`, `prompter:load` or `files:import`.

`input` on any permission other than `prompter:control` is
`PACK_PERMISSION_OPTION`; `input` with neither `keyboard` nor `mouse` is
`PACK_MANIFEST_SCHEMA`.

#### Input and internet in one pack

A pack can ask for input, or for internet access, without restriction on the
other. A pack (or bundle) that does **both** may read input only if the input is
**narrow**; otherwise it's `PACK_INPUT_PACK_NETWORK`, and the message says which
limit failed:

- `keyboard` lists its `keys`, at most 8.
- `mouse` lists its `buttons`, at most 3, and sets neither `wheel` nor `position`.
- `scope` is `"focused"` (the default), never `"global"`.

The check covers every input declaration in the pack and in every pack it
includes, at any depth, whichever pack holds the network. Input and network may
share a permission, and then share a sandbox.

Why any limit: the sandbox split doesn't keep input in. Sandboxes share
nothing in memory, but they share the app's state, such as the prompter's
position, so one sandbox could encode input into that state and another that has
`net` could read it out and send it away. Narrow input makes that channel close
to worthless: a handful of named keys, pressed while eyeread.in is focused and
never in a text field, and no analog values. It is **not** zero. A pack that
qualifies can still learn when one of its listed keys was pressed, so the app
tells the user exactly which keys and sites (the install prompt and the grant
grid), and review checks the pack.

Two separately installed packs can still work together through the same shared
state. The content policy forbids that and review looks for it: input may only
drive the prompter and must never be encoded into script text, titles, seek
positions, settings or logs (see `PACK_POLICY.md`).

### Internet access, per permission

Internet is off unless a permission declares it. `network` lists the exact sites
that permission's code may call through `eyeread.net.fetch`:

```json
"permissions": {
  "scripts:write": { "network": ["https://api.notion.com"] },
  "prompter:control": {}
}
```

A site is an origin: `https://`, a DNS host name, and an optional port. No path,
no trailing slash, no wildcard, no IP address, no `localhost`, no user info, and
lowercase only. The host needs at least one dot, and its last label starts with a
letter. Up to 16 sites per permission. Declaring a site doesn't turn internet
on: the user still switches it on per permission, and it starts off.

The app runs each permission that declares `network` in its **own sandbox**,
with only that permission's API and `net`. All permissions without `network`
share one offline sandbox. See [`API.md`](API.md).

### Declared settings

Options the user sets in the pack's Settings screen, drawn with the app's own
controls. Packs read them with `eyeread.settings.get()`.

| `type`   | Extra fields                                                     | Value     | Default when omitted |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| `toggle` | none                                                             | `boolean` | `false`              |
| `select` | `options`: 1–50 of `{ "value", "label" }`                        | `string`  | first option         |
| `number` | `min`?, `max`?, `step`? (> 0), `unit`? (≤ 16 characters)         | `number`  | `min`, else `0`      |
| `text`   | `maxLength`? (1–2000, default 200), `placeholder`?, `multiline`? | `string`  | `""`                 |
| `key`    | none                                                             | `string`  | `""`                 |

Every setting has `key` (a letter, then letters, digits or `_`; up to 64
characters), `type`, `label` (1–64 characters) and optionally `description` (up
to 280) and `default`. Keys are unique. A `select` default must be one of its
options; a `number` default must be within `min`–`max`, and `min` ≤ `max`; a
`text` default must fit `maxLength`.

A `key` setting is drawn as a "press a key" control. Its value is a `KeyboardEvent.code` string such as `"KeyN"`, or `""` for none, and a `default` follows the same rule. It lets users rebind a pack's keys without a declared `keys` list changing.

There is no secret setting type in v1. Values are stored per pack id and survive
updates; a key that disappears in an update is dropped.

## Paths and files

Every entry in the zip must be a regular file or a directory, with a path that:

- is relative, uses `/`, and doesn't start with `/`, a drive letter (`C:`) or `\\`;
- has no `..` or `.` segment, no empty segment, no backslash, and no control
  character or NUL;
- is at most 255 bytes of UTF-8, and at most 16 segments deep;
- doesn't differ from another entry's path only by letter case.

Symlinks, hard links and device files are rejected. `__MACOSX/…` and `.DS_Store`
entries are skipped: they're neither extracted nor hashed. When a pack is read
from a folder, a `.git` at the folder's top level is skipped too, so the folder
can be a git repo's root.

Allowed file types: `.js`, `.mjs`, `.json`, `.md`, `.txt`, `.css`, `.svg`,
`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, plus files named `LICENSE`, `COPYING`,
`NOTICE`, `README`, `AUTHORS` or `CHANGELOG` with no extension. No WebAssembly,
no native code, no HTML.

### Code

- `main` must name a file in the pack; otherwise `PACK_MAIN_MISSING`.
- `main` is an **ES module**. It can `import` other files in the same pack by
  relative path. Remote imports are blocked.
- **Source must be readable.** A `.js` or `.mjs` file counts as minified, and is
  rejected, if any line is longer than 1000 characters, or if it's at least
  2048 bytes and averages more than 200 bytes per line. Lines end at `\n` (a
  `\r` before it is part of the line ending), a final newline doesn't start
  another line, and characters are Unicode code points.

### License

Any license is allowed. The manifest's `license` says which one, and the app
shows it to the user; it isn't checked. A `LICENSE` file is optional. What is
required, whatever the license, is readable source (above).

## Limits

| Limit                             | Value  |
| --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Zip file size                     | 20 MiB |
| Total size, uncompressed          | 20 MiB |
| Largest single file, uncompressed | 5 MiB  |
| Files (including included packs)  | 500    |
| Included packs, all levels        | 32     |
| Bundle nesting depth              | 4      |

Limits are enforced while unzipping, on the actual bytes written, not on the
sizes the zip claims.

## `files.json`

A per-file SHA-256 list, validated by [`files.schema.json`](files.schema.json).
The build tool writes it; the installer computes it itself when it's missing.

```json
{
  "format": 1,
  "id": "com.example.notion-sync",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "files": {
    "LICENSE": "<64 lowercase hex characters>",
    "main.js": "…",
    "pack.json": "…"
  }
}
```

- `id` and `version` must equal the manifest's.
- `files` lists **every** file in the pack (including `pack.json`) except
  `files.json`, `files.json.minisig`, anything under `packs/`, and the skipped
  `__MACOSX` / `.DS_Store` entries. Hashes are lowercase hex SHA-256 of the raw
  bytes.
- At install, and again before every launch, the set of files on disk must equal
  the set of keys, and every hash must match. A missing, extra or changed file
  fails with `PACK_FILES_MISMATCH`, and an installed pack is disabled until the
  user approves it again.

**Canonical form.** Keys in the order `format`, `id`, `version`, `files`;
`files` sorted by path (byte order); two-space indentation; one trailing
newline. It's what `JSON.stringify(value, null, 2) + "\n"` prints for a value
built in that order. The build tool always writes the canonical form.

**Pack hash.** The SHA-256 of the pack's `files.json` in canonical form,
recomputed from the files on disk. It identifies one exact version of one pack:
bundles share installed packs by it, and the revocation list blocks by it.

## Signature: `files.json.minisig`

A [minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) (Ed25519) signature over the
exact bytes of `files.json`, made with OmniShip's key. It's the same scheme the
app's updater uses.

- The app embeds **two public keys**, main and backup; either may sign.
- The signature's **trusted comment** must be exactly
  `eyeread.in pack <id>@<version> <pack hash>`.
- Because `files.json` names the id, version and every file's hash, and the
  trusted comment repeats them, the signature is bound to one version of one
  pack. Any edit, or copying the signature onto another pack, breaks it.

| Result      | When                                                            | Shown as                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `verified`  | The signature verifies, and the pack hash isn't revoked         | ✓ Verified by eyeread.in        |
| `community` | There's no `files.json.minisig`                                 | Community (with a warning)      |
| `invalid`   | A signature is present but doesn't verify: treated as tampering | Blocked                         |
| `revoked`   | The pack hash is on the app's revocation list                   | Blocked, with the list's reason |

A **bundle** is `verified` only if it and every pack it includes are. Developer
mode packs are shown as `Dev` and never verified.

## Bundles

A pack with `includes` is a bundle. Its `packs/` folder holds every pack it
needs, at any level, **flat**: `packs/<id>/` for each one, with no deeper
`packs/` folders.

- Each entry in `includes` (and each included pack's own `includes`) must match a
  folder `packs/<id>/` whose `pack.json` has that exact `id` and `version`, or
  the install fails with `PACK_INCLUDE_MISSING` (or `PACK_INCLUDE_VERSION` when
  only the version differs).
- An `id` may appear once in a pack's `includes` (`PACK_INCLUDE_DUPLICATE`).
- The graph must have no cycles (`PACK_INCLUDE_CYCLE`), at most 32 packs, and at
  most 4 levels of nesting (`PACK_INCLUDE_LIMIT`).
- Every folder under `packs/` must be reachable from the top-level pack's
  `includes` (`PACK_INCLUDE_UNUSED`).
- Each included pack is validated as a pack in its own right, with its own
  `files.json` and signature.
- An included pack that's already installed with the same pack hash is shared,
  not installed twice, and keeps its settings. Uninstalling a bundle removes only
  the packs nothing else uses.

## Validation errors

Every check above fails with a code from [`errors.json`](errors.json), which
also holds the message text. The app's installer and Developer mode, and the
CLI's `validate`, print the same codes and wording. Placeholders in braces are
filled in; `{path}` is always the path inside the pack.

Checks run in this order, and the first failure is the one reported, so every
tool gives the same answer for the same pack:

1. The zip and its entries: `PACK_ZIP_INVALID`, `PACK_TOO_LARGE`,
   `PACK_TOO_MANY_FILES`, `PACK_FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `PACK_PATH_UNSAFE`,
   `PACK_LINK_NOT_ALLOWED`, `PACK_PATH_DUPLICATE`, `PACK_FILE_TYPE`.
2. The manifest can be read: `PACK_MANIFEST_MISSING`, `PACK_MANIFEST_INVALID_JSON`.
3. `PACK_API_VERSION`, when `apiVersion` is an integer the app doesn't support
   (a newer manifest may not match this schema).
4. `PACK_NETWORK_SITE`, for the first string in a `network` list that isn't a
   valid site.
5. `PACK_MANIFEST_SCHEMA`: anything else the schema rejects.
6. `PACK_APP_VERSION`, `PACK_SETTINGS`.
7. `PACK_MAIN_MISSING`, `PACK_MINIFIED`.
8. `PACK_FILES_JSON_INVALID`, `PACK_FILES_MISMATCH`.
9. Bundles: `PACK_INCLUDE_DUPLICATE`, `PACK_INCLUDE_MISSING`,
   `PACK_INCLUDE_VERSION`, `PACK_INCLUDE_CYCLE`, `PACK_INCLUDE_LIMIT`,
   `PACK_INCLUDE_UNUSED`, then steps 2–8 for each included pack, in `includes`
   order, depth first. Walking the graph reads each included `pack.json`; if
   one is missing or isn't JSON, that error is reported when the walk reaches
   it. Files under `packs/` that aren't inside a pack folder, and `packs/`
   folders inside an included pack, count as `PACK_INCLUDE_UNUSED`.
10. `PACK_SIGNATURE_INVALID`, `PACK_REVOKED`.

[`fixtures/`](fixtures) has a pack for each of these, with the code it must fail
with in `fixtures/expected.json`.
